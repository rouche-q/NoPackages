# NoPackages

## WHAT

A React-native app without any other external packages.

I remade a scrappy router and a diy redux, it's not heavy and it works.

So try it at home !

## WHY ?

Because someone dared me to do this and I wanna shut their mouth

And because i like to reinvent the wheel

## NEXT STEP ?
  
  - [ ] BackHandler
  - [ ] History in router
  - [ ] Animation when page change in router
  - [ ] External call to api
  - [ ] Make test with Jest (I know)
  - [ ] Make a doc
  - [ ] Put it on Google Play
